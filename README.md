Anaconda notebook with outputs is too large to upload to github. File can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vMEPiOLsxiCtWoklHe5heB_6qc1jmy8/view?usp=sharing.


For this project, we applied machine learning and data analytics to predict the 2020 presidential election results in Florida by county. We based our model off of the 2016 demographic data for each county, and we compared
our results to the real election results. 

For our machine learning model, we used a CatBoost regressor because we did not have extensive data to properly use a typical machine learning model. More details can be found in the report PDF.
